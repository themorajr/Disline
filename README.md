# LINE to Discord File Bot

## About

In Thai culture, LINE is one of the most popular communication platforms, especially for group chats. This project aims to create a LINE chatbot that collects and downloads files shared in a LINE group chat, then automatically posts those files to a designated Discord channel.

## Features

- **Collect Files**: The LINE chatbot listens for file messages in the group chat and downloads them.
- **Post to Discord**: After downloading the file, the bot automatically forwards it to a pre-configured Discord channel.
- **File Management**: Files are stored temporarily on the server and can be managed via a future web-based GUI (e.g., file deletion, type, and size limits).
